Cybersecurity Monitoring Platform
A comprehensive monitoring and response system for detecting and reacting to web-based cyber threats in real time.

Overview
This platform integrates advanced monitoring tools such as UptimeRobot and BetterStack with a robust PHP–MySQL backend, providing continuous surveillance of website uptime, performance metrics, and security events. An Admin Dashboard offers administrators real-time insights, enabling quick response to incidents and proactive defense against common and emerging cyber threats.

Features
Real-Time Monitoring
Automatically checks website availability and performance. Detects anomalies like downtime or suspicious server activity.
Alerts and Incident Handling
Configurable thresholds trigger alerts via email (or other channels). Incident logs can be viewed, filtered, and managed from a centralized dashboard.
Robust Security
Implements firewalls, encryption (SSL/TLS), and role-based access control to protect both the platform and the monitored assets.
Scalable Architecture
Utilizes Hostinger hosting for high uptime and performance, plus backup and redundancy strategies for fault tolerance.
Detailed Logs and Reporting
Stores logs, incidents, and user actions in a MySQL database for easy retrieval and auditing. Generate reports as needed.
